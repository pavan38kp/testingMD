# NFTs Basics

There is a lot of misconception about NFTs, it's crucial to understand NFTs, and their uses, before moving further.

  

What is an NFT exactly?
=======================

An NFT is an abbreviation for (Non-Fungible Token), and this is one of the common answers found online. But let's demystify it.

  

An NFT is actually a type of standard EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) contract known as ERC721. The feature of ERC721 is that any data stored in this contract is considered as the original and unique token. And it is Non-Fungible, meaning it cannot be replaced.

  

Hence people use this standard to mint assets such as artwork, agreements, sensitive documents, etc. Since ERC721 is non-fungible, it creates trust among people to add their work or documents as NFT and store them on the chain.

  

NFT is not only limited to images, it can also be, SVGs, video, audio, gifs, documents, 3D graphics, etc. NFTs are used as per the requirements and not all the NFTs are listed for sale.

  

What is the ERC721 contract?
============================

The ERC721 is like a regular contract written in Solidity. But here's why it is called a standard contract. There are a lot of application out there, that allows people to buy and sell NFTs, and if a user needs to sell them, they need to list it on many platforms to attract customers.

  

But what if there was no ERC721 or any standard contract available, all these platforms would have their own rules and structure, and they would expect these users to follow them to list their artwork or any other asset, and this not only leads to duplicate data, it also makes it hard to track and update the sales.

  

The standard contracts follow one common rule and structure, every platform can adopt them, and users don't have to deal with various rules. An ERC721 contract is a standard contract in the Ethereum ecosystem, any platform that deals with NFTs should support ERC721.

  

When users mint their NFTs, these platforms can look up and fetch the NFT details with the help of the contract address and NFT id. This allows users to trade NFTs on any platform, and those sales will be reflected on all the other platforms.
