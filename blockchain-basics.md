# Blockchain Basics

Before getting started with the project, let's get the basics right.

  

What is a Blockchain?
=====================

The Blockchain is a **network of computers**, that are **distributed** throughout the world. These computers maintain and store the data involved in a transaction. The data stored here are **immutable**, meaning they cannot be modified once added.

  

Usually, Blockchains are **decentralized**, they are not controlled by any entity or organization. For example, Ethereum is a community-run Blockchain.

  

Although this does not apply to all Blockchain, depending on the need, some Blockchains are semi-centralized, such as Solana.

What is a Smart Contract?
=========================

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when invoked and predetermined conditions are met. Here the predetermined conditions specify the parameters required for execution.

  

For example, to transfer an NFT, I need to own it first, this is one of the conditions.

  

The smart contracts are unalterable and incorruptible, they act on the conditions defined, this increases the trust for using Blockchain and also eliminates third parties.

  

What is Solidity?
=================

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.

  

Many blockchain ecosystems use different languages for developing smart contracts. Example

*   Solana uses Rust
*   Cardano uses Haskel
*   Ethereum and its associated chains use Solidity
*   Bitcoin uses Script

  

Hey! you made it ðŸ¥³, you're good with basics now, let's move to the next chapter and learn about NFTs.
